# Talbot Lab Xenium

This repository collects the work by **Spatialist** on the Talbot Lab Xenium analysis of **skin grafts** and **melanoma** samples.  
The analysis is organized into three levels:

- **Level 1**  
  Provides an overall breakdown of transcript content per sample.  
  - Summarizes segmentation strategies and evaluates their impact on cell size, transcript density, and overall cell counts  
  - Presents transcript-level QC metrics, including total counts and detected genes per cell  
  - Identifies potential low-quality cells or outlier samples  
  - Compares QC metrics across samples and experimental conditions to highlight technical variation or biases  
  - Establishes a transparent baseline for downstream analyses, ensuring that filtering decisions and biological conclusions are built on well-documented QC checks  

- **Level 2**  
  Separates the samples from one another and performs targeted comparisons between selected sample groups, as specified by the customer.  

- **Level 3**  
  Cell-focused analysis, drilling down to fine-grained patterns at the single-cell level.
